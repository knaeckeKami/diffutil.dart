## 4.0.0

- Fix bug that caused wrong update list to be returned when the list would contain duplicate items (see https://github.com/knaeckeKami/diffutil.dart/issues/15)
- BREAKING: add sealed class modifiers to data classes, require Dart 3.0

## 3.0.0


- added `DiffResult::getUpdatesWithData`. To make this work, following changes have been made: 
    -  The functions `calculateDiff()`, `calculateListDiff`, `calculateCustomListDiff` now have an additional 
       generic type parameter. This is a breaking change (if you used `calculateCustomListDiff`
       with a single explicit type parameter, it now has two)
    - `DiffResult`has now a generic type parameter for the type of the data of the underlying lists
